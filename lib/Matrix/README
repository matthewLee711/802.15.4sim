 Matrix
--------

This repository contains an arithmetic matrix class in C++ for
double-precision, real-valued data.  The aim of this project is to
create an object-oriented framework with two goals:

1. Matlab-like simplicity
2. C++ speed


This class was created for use within the course:

  Introduction to High-Performance Scientific Computing
  MATH 3316, Southern Methodist University

It was originally authored by Prof. Daniel Reynolds, but has received
contributions from numerous students, including: Jean Sexton, Jarret
Shook, Arya McCarthy.

I hope you find this to be useful.  

Suggestions and contributions are welcome, however I request that all
contributions be submitted through Bitbucket's "Pull Request"
mechanism.
